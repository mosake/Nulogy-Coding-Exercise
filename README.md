Link Apprenticeship Coding Exercise README

runtime versions: 
  Java -        Ver. 8, Update 121
  Checkstyle -  Ver 7.6
  jUnit -       Ver 4
  
no dependencies outside of jar file

how to run in Windows/Linux cmd line:
  go to the directory where markupCalc.jar is stored
  >>> java -jar markupCalc.jar "input"
  
  ex.
  >>> java -jar markupCalc.jar "$5,432.00, 1 person, drugs"
  
  
  
This was a fun exercise.
Unfortunately I only saw this job application yesterday but I did the best I could!
This program follows checkstyle, the Decorator design pattern and the Singleton design pattern.
Also there are comments for the longer methods.

I had to google how to catch stdout again. I hope you enjoy my little joke in the comments.

Cheers,
